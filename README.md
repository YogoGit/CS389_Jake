# CS389_AdvSoftwareProject
A repository to house the semester long project for CS-389: Advanced Software Engineering.

This project is a webapp with an ip "tracker" which stores the information of people connecting to the webapp.
It is a very simple project and eventually is intended to house a resume of sorts; however, actually fleshing this out is low on my priority list.

In order to deploy, ensure that you have docker and docker compose installed on your computer.

Navigate to the releases for this repository and download the latest DockerDeployment.zip file.

Proceed to unzip this on your local machine and, through the command-line interface of your choosing, navigate to the file produced by the zip extraction.

Lastly, run the command "docker compose up" to launch the application.

The webapp can be accessed via the address "localhost:8080".
